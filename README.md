# The Betrothed
The Betrothed is a platformer written in Python with the aid of Pygame.

## How do I run the code?
**If you just want to play The Betrothed:**
1. Go on the `Releases` page and check for the latest stable version (or any other one, if you want)
2. Download the file that best matches your system:
   - Python 3.8.10 for **Windows Vista and higher**: for example `the_betrothed_001_py38.zip`
   - The latest Python release for **Windows 8.1 and higher**: for example `the_betrothed_001_py310.zip`

   *__All executables are 32-bit, which means they are compatible with both x86 and x64 architectures.__*
3. Extract the `zip` file
4. Start `the_betrothed.exe`

*Note: either your antivirus or Microsoft SmartScreen might block the file thinking it's a virus. The Betrothed is **not** a virus. If you don't trust me, check the code for yourself. Please make an exception for the folder you extracted The Betrothed in or ignore the Microsoft SmartScreen warning. Thank you!*

**If you instead want to run the source code:**
1. Go on the `Releases` page and check for whatever version you want to run
2. Download the `Source Code` as an archive
3. Extract the archive
4. Run `main.py` with at least Python 3.8 (probably it works with previous versions but I don't guarantee)

## How do I compile the code?
1. Make sure to have Python 3.8 or higher (32-bit Python for wider compatibility)
2. Grab the Pyinstaller version that matches what is used with your target game version:
   - Pyinstaller 4.8 for **The Betrothed 0.03+**
   - Pyinstaller 4.8 for **The Betrothed 0.02**
   - Pyinstaller 4.7 for **The Betrothed 0.01**
3. Compile with Pyinstaller
