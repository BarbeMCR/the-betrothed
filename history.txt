HISTORY OF "BarbeMCR's THE BETROTHED"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Release 0.17 - The Run Update
=============================
Build 1113
Python 3.11.0
Pygame 2.1.3.dev8
*Released on November 13th, 2022*
### Running
- Now the player can run for a substantial speed boost: you can change your speed by pressing the right trigger of your controller alongside the left/right D-Pad button, up to 2x speed with the trigger fully pushed in. On the keyboard, you can press both A/D and the Left CTRL for a 1.5x speed boost or the Left CTRL and the Left ALT for a 2x speed boost
### Stamina
- Added stamina: the player can't run if their stamina bar is empty
- Now the stamina bar gets depleted if the player runs
- Now the stamina bar slowly increases if the player is not running (walking will make it increase more slowly than idlingm though)
### Delta
- Now the delta is passed to a variety of things, so that the core gameplay works decently even at very low framerates (delta stops working as expected at around 10-12 fps), and the game is smoother than ever at high framerates
- Increased the delta cap to 0.08 seconds between frames (previously was 0.03): this causes the game to run fine even at framerates as low as 12 fps (lower than that it would risk breaking the physics engine)
### Main menu
- Changed the main menu background (much better, in my opinion)
- Changed the text color for the options to white (previously was gray)
### Levels
- Removed the top layer of barriers in all levels: turns out it was the cause of some teleportation glitches
- Changed the spawn point of Chapter I-B to avoid an occasional teleportation glitch immediately after spawning in the player
### Overlay
- Now the overlay gets toggled using the `backslash` key, instead of the left `ctrl`
### World
- The level selector now moves at a speed of 12 pixels per frame (previously was 6): unfortunately, we cannot easily apply the delta here as there would be strange collision glitches between the level selector and the level icons
### Technical details
- Removed LGTM comments (Rest In Peace LGTM!): a Github Action workflow will be used from now on to lint all the Python files in the repository
- Cleaned up `versions.py` as development versions are not public
## Known issues
- Now that delta gets passed to many objects, the game is more prone to breaking the physics engine at low framerates: you'll probably see more teleportation glitches when running at 20 fps than when running at 60 fps. However, this can't be easily fixed and will probably stay that way forever. It's just the price to pay for framerate independency!

Release 0.16 - The Enemy Update
===============================
Build 1106
Python 3.11.0
Pygame 2.1.3.dev8
*Released on November 6th, 2022*
### Enemies
- Added Melee and Ranged Resistance to enemies: in certain types of enemies, they are present and reduce the amount of damage received by the enemies when using the respective weapon types. Each level of resistance reduces damage by 20%, with level 5 being immunity. For example, zombies, who have Ranged Resistance I, will be dealt 20% less damage from ranged weapons
- Added zombies: they have 2 HP and deal 2 Physical Damage. They also have Ranged Resistance I
- Now stomping on an enemy can (in 25% of the cases) deal 1/10 of the normal damage (however, it deals Pure Damage). Previously it dealt 1/4 of the normal damage (way too much)
- The enemy invulnerability has been slightly reduced to avoid spamming: now the default stun duration ranges between 400 and 500 milliseconds (previously was 750). The stun duration with slower weapons (which have not yet been introduced) has been affected as well, although it is pretty complex to explain
### Health
- Now fractional damage can be applied to the player: in order to get the actual health value, you must put together a number that has for integer part the value displayed next to the health bar and for decimal part the value displayed next to the health remainder bar
### UI
- Now you can toggle the overlay between the default one and a minimal one (with only the health bar shown): this is especially useful when traveling from right to left, like when exiting one-way caves
- Now the health remainder is displayed below the energy bar
### Camera
- Now the camera starts moving when the player gets past two fifths of the screen width from each window border (in other words, the camera does not move when the player is in the central fifth of the screen)
### Levels
- Slightly tweaked a few levels to reduce the occurance of a stubborn teleporation bug
### Textboxes
- Now key presses will be repeated every 50 milliseconds after 0.5 seconds of holding them down
- Now the controller `A` or `Cross` button can be pressed to confirm the input
### Terrain
- Now only the outermost layer of terrain tiles is checked for player collisions: this saves quite a bit of time each frame, especially in levels where there are huge extensions of terrain (like Chapter I-A)
### Controls
- The controls screen has been revamped: now the font is smaller, the lines are closer together, the `Back` button has been moved to the bottom right corner and the controls are described more in-depth
### Mouse
- Now the mouse cursor is hidden when hovering over the game window
### Splashes
- Added 4 new splashes
- Changed 2 splashes
### Bugfixes
- Now timers work correctly when pausing and resuming
- The player no longer slides back when melee attacking while facing left
- The player now takes the correct amount of damage when stomping
### Technical details
- Updated to Pyinstaller 5.6.2
- The game is no longer capped at 60 FPS (thanks to `delta`!)
- Now `FlintArrows.__init__` initializes its parent object through `RangedProjectilePack.__init__`
- Now the collision between the player and the enemies is checked using the `Player.collision_rect` instead of the `Player.rect`
- Now the code to get whether the player is melee attacking is run before the animation code to avoid single-frame blitting inconsistencies
- Now `Level.check_enemy_collisions` uses the `Player.collision_rect.bottom` instead of the `Player.rect.bottom`
- Now `Game.load` no longer stores an unnecessary local variable `savefile_version` after upgrading
- Now the `Player.player_hurt_sfx` plays regardless of the type of damage
- The Pixel Madness embedded font has been updated to version 2.0: more latin glyphs and a few updated ones in this release

Release 0.15 - The Ranged Update
================================
Build 829
Python 3.10.6
Pygame 2.1.2
*Released on August 29th, 2022*
### Weapons
- Added ranged weapons: unlike melee attacks, the player doesn't stop moving horizontally when attacking
- Ranged weapons cannot fire infinitely: instead, they can fire up to 50 times (for now)
- However, ranged weapons have a much higher range of attack than melee weapons
- The enemies now get stunned for the cooldown time of the ranged weapon used
- Added the Makeshift Bow: a decent ranged weapon that deals 1 Ranged Damage, has a cooldown of 0.3 seconds and uses Flint Arrows
- Added weapon levels (at least technically: no weapon upgrade system... yet!)
- Weapons now store their damage values in a dictionary to allow for a future weapon level system implementation
### UI
- Added the ranged weapon overlay: it is displayed next to the melee weapon overlay
### Player
- The player can now make ranged attacks (see how in the Controls section of the README)
### World
- Now the code to change parts and subparts has been implemented: it is not possible to switch between parts manually and you can only go to previous subparts (and not get back to where you were without completing at least the last level of each subpart), so make sure you think carefully about it first
- The `World` class in `world.py` no longer accepts the `first_level` argument, which has been completely removed
### Savefile
- Now the game automatically upgrades savefiles to the latest version
- Now the game autosaves each time a level is completed to avoid losing progress
- Now the game accepts empty savefile names: it is useful if you want to avoid creating a savefile when starting a new game
### Window
- Now the window title has been changed to `BarbeMCR's The Betrothed` to reflect the change of name in the official documentation (the same thing is now also true for the heading of `history.txt`)
### Enemies
- Now enemies get stunned after being hit by a melee weapon attack for the duration of the melee weapon cooldown (and an additional 250 milliseconds if the cooldown is less than 750 milliseconds)
- Now enemies get stunned for at least 750 milliseconds
### Delta
- A delta cap has been implemented to avoid sudden movement when lag spikes occur: this delta cap takes effect when the game is running slower than around 35 FPS
### UI
- Now the quantity of energy present in the energy overflow bar is displayed
- The energy overflow bar has been moved: it is now placed below the energy bar (in the right side)
### Splashes
- Added 12 new splashes
### Bugfixes
- The game now resets the path to the savefile after deleting one to avoid accidentally rewriting to it
- Background object no longer move erraticaly when some lag is present
### Technical details
- Changed the savefile loading algorithm to use a new `Game._load` method for the actual loading part to allow for a correct upgrading procedure
- Removed redundant code in file `player.py`, in class `Player`, in method `take_damage`
- In `./assets/level/ground/ground_day.png` and `./assets/level/ground/bg_day.png` color #000000 has been replaced with color #010101 to avoid side effects when transforming the image (might be useful in future in-game, right now this reduces the amount of work I have to do in external tools)
- Now the dictionary `versions` in `versions.py` has its entries listed backwards to facilitate reading it (also, key `7122` with value `0.12-build712(2)` was removed as it doesn't and didn't serve any particular purpose)

### Updates
- Now the game automatically tries to check for updates: if it fails to do so, it will silently continue startup
- Now the game displays a message for a few seconds if an update is found
- Now the game automatically downloads the update and saves it to './data' if autoupdate is enabled (by default it is not)
